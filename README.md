# Project_Euler
These are my Project Euler solutions! (if you haven't heard of project euler check it out - http://project-euler.net/about)

Basically what I've been doing is writing up solutions to a bunch of the problems from Project Euler - I started them around May of 2012 and have been working on them sporadically ever since. By no means am I an experienced programmer but I'm learning and that's what it's all about!

So, this git (is that what it's called?) is just to show off my work. It's been made entirely by me and mostly in Java. The programs aren't commented very well/at all because frankly I didn't intend to show these off ever. Maybe I'll go back through and give them some comments. It's also a bit of an experiment in github - I expect I'll be using it at some point in my future so I figured I might as well get to know it works.
